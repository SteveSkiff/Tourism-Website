    <p class="section-primarytext">The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. This is truly an almighty mountain.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. We'll do another happy little painting. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">Nothing wrong with washing your brush. It's a super day, so why not make a   beautiful sky? We don't have anything but happy trees here. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Very easy to work these to death. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">That's crazy. Let the paint work. Poor old tree. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa'   with a two-inch brush. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

    <p class="section-primarytext">Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>
